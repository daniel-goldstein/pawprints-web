Tired of learning flag? Well, this won't help with that, but this tool will ease the pain that comes next of tracking and completing solved clues. Manage and update clue locations for a more efficient Husky Hunt experience.

## Archiving Note
Pawprints served the Chicken Louttle team well in our winning year at Disney Husky Hunt 2019! Officially retired, it is left here as a learning resource for any future teams who want to create their own tools for solving Husky Hunt's hardest problems.
