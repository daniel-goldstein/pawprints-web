Tired of learning flag? Well, this won't help with that, but this tool will ease the pain that comes next of tracking and completing solved clues. Manage and update clue locations for a more efficient Husky Hunt experience.

## Development
Clone this repo, obtain a properties file from Daniel and get hacking!

## TODO
- Clue location editing
- Clue deletion
- Clue list view (with search by id, title or location, and sorting)
- Options for color coding:
    * By list/priority
    * Color crawls
    * Completed/not completed

## Bugs
- Flash and two-shutter bug in expo camera (consider switching library)
